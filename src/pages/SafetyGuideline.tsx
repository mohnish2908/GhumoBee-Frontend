            Take time to exchange messages, ask questions, and clearly discuss expectations before confirming a stay or hosting someone. Good communication builds trust and sets the tone for a great experience.

          </h2>
          <p>
            It's natural to be careful when connecting with someone new. Ask for details, share only what you're comfortable with, and trust your instincts. If something doesn‚Äôt feel right, it‚Äôs okay to pause or walk away.

            3. Respect Local Culture and House Rules
          </h2>
          <p>
            Travelers should always respect the customs, laws, and expectations of their host and the local community. Hosts should clearly communicate any house rules or guidelines before the stay begins.
